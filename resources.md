* [Precomputed VQMs for the ITS4S dataset](https://media.polito.it/its4s/){: target=_blank}  
  (accompanying the paper ["Full Reference Video Quality Measures Improvement using Neural Networks"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053739) [(alt link)](http://hdl.handle.net/11583/2840345) published in IEEE ICASSP 2020)


## Software

List of software tools freely available for research purposes, developed in the context of the groups' activities or made available for the group:

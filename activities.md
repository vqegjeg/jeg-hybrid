Current activities include but are not limited to:

* Modeling single observers: to mimic the behavior of single observers in subjective experiments, to investigate/understand their characteristics, and potentially to run "virtual" subjective experiments.

* Modeling VQM disagreement: to achieve better design of subjective experiments, to give hints about which video sequences are most likely to make VQM predictions fail.

* Training machine learning models with a low amount of subjectively annotated data, and/or with (less reliably) automatically annotated data, and using them to improve existing VQMs.

* Improving subjective testing and experiments by finding the most interesting sources (SRCs) and/or processed video sequences (PVSs) to work with.

* Overcoming the MOS limitations by considering subjective score ranges and distributions.

* Developing methods, approaches, frameworks, and tools to promote reproducible research in the context of Video Quality Assessment (VQA).

* Using large scale (not subjectively annotated) datasets to identify shortcomings of common Video Quality Metrics (VQMs) in various conditions, e.g., different coding parameters, lossy channels.

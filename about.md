If you are interested in joining the group, please join the reflector (maintained by VQEG): [jeg@lyris.vqeg.org](mailto:jeg@lyris.vqeg.org). Meeting info [here]({{site.baseurl}}/meetings).

Please be aware that this is a scientific working group. This implies that often results are yet unverified. In many cases, researchers also lack time to document work-in-progress. Please consider this as reason why there is not a lot of written documentation available. We discuss work in progress in our biweekly conference calls and either officially publish the results or update the documentation when our research is stable and validated.

The best way to get started is to join the VQEG reflector and the VQEG-JEG reflector or contact the co-chairs if you have trouble with this.

To contact the co-chairs, write an email to the reflector or join a conference call. In any case, it is suggested to provide a short introduction of yourself and your research. The best way is to do it in a conference call (5-10 minutes, if you have slides you are welcome to send them to the reflector beforehand but this is not mandatory). In the following discussion, we will conjointly integrate your research topic and ideas into the currently ongoing  research. More detailed calls or mail exchanges will follow naturally.

title: IGVQM (Implementer's Guide to Video Quality Metrics)

In a recent face-to-face VQEG meeting (Dec 2022, online) it was agreed to move the activities of the [VQEG](https://vqeg.org) IGVQM (Implementer's Guide to Video Quality Metrics) group into JEG-Hybrid.

Originally, IGVQM had a quite broad scope (see [working doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w3rgGxDHFehwdwtVXENtngAPsMhGnPlAsiU2v0Tu6nU/edit?usp=sharing)), for instance:

* Priority to full-reference (pixel) metrics, but also applicability of no-ref
    * Use at least all metrics in VMAF library, focus on open-source solutions
* Offer temporal aggregation methods of image quality metrics into video ones
* Statistical analysis of existing subjective datasets (limited to compression and scaling)
* Offer standard logistic mappings of objective metrics to normalized linear scale

**Currently**, in JEG-Hybrid, due to the limited resources, **initially we plan to**:

* Restrict the scope (at least initially) by focusing on some specific aspects (e.g., temporal pooling)
* Start with the already available objective measures (e.g., HDTV, ITS4S)
* Try to create synergies between the current JEG-Hybrid activities and the IGVQM ones
* Include the existing JEG-Hybrid experimentations on AI observers while carrying out some of the activities envisaged by IGVMQ, e.g., objective metrics computation and analysis

Also, IGVQG received pointer to ITU-T Technical paper HSTP-VID-WPOM titled "[Working practices using objective metrics for evaluation of video coding efficiency experiments](https://www.itu.int/pub/T-TUT-ASC-2020-HSTP1)" (persistent [link](http://handle.itu.int/11.1002/pub/8160e8da-en))

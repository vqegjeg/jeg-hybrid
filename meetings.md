- Statistical analysis of objective Full-Reference measures towards
understanding which data needs to be subjectively evaluated
- Databases (HDTV dataset evaluation, SRC collection, H.264, HEVC,
annotation with objective measurements, ...)
- Combination algorithms for indicators / training / verification /
validation including statistical analysis
- Organization of reproducible research: by means of using Virtualbox, HMIX files and
tools, MySQL database creation

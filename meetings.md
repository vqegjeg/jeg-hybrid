Conference calls are held online every 2 weeks. Duration about 1 hour, occasionally 1.5 hours.  An agenda is proposed on the reflector some time before the meeting and agreed upon as soon as the meeting starts.

Next meeting dates:

* December 2024 and January 2025: *NO meetings* (unavailability, and vacation time)
* Feb 3, 2025, 4 PM CET/CEST (Contact co-chairs for the zoom link)

Past meeting dates [here]({{site.baseurl}}/past_meetings) (with important decisions)

Schedule is adapted once in a while to facilitate participation by most of the attendees. Polls and modifications are sent to the reflector well ahead of time. Do not forget to join the reflector: [jeg@lyris.vqeg.org](mailto:jeg@lyris.vqeg.org)
